The goal of this website is to practice coding Javascript while solving problems for my wife's work. Hopefully, we can automate some tasks that are otherwise time consuming. I want to practice creating and using a database. 

html forms
javascript working with calender
basic student and teacher database

JavaScript Features

Create an array, dictionary or list, populate it with multiple values, retrieve at least one value, and use or display it in your application

Create and use a function that accepts two or more values (parameters), calculates or determines a new value based on those inputs, and returns a new value

Implement a regular expression (regex) to ensure a field either a phone number or an email address is always stored and displayed in the same format

Visualize data in a graph, chart, or other visual representation of data

Additional Features you can include but may not be covered by Treehouse:

1. Implement a drag-and-drop interface that allows the user to move elements or items on the page around (reference). For example, drag a file or image into the app from your desktop and have it display. 

2. Develop your project using a common JavaScript framework such as React, Angular, Vue, etc.

3. Create a web server with at least one route and connect to it from your application using ExpressJS
