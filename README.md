# iinchou: a classroom organizer

"iinchou" is Japanese for "class representative". That is exactly what this app strives to be! It is intended for an admin and teachers to organize students into classrooms. I hope to expand it to handle important holidays/ days off. and maybe an attendance and messaging system.

### Installation Instructions:
1. Clone repository from github. "https://www.github.com/EvanDBush.classroom-organizer"

2. Install node dependencies. "npm install" in project directory terminal.

3. Create "nodemon.json" file in root directory.

4. Inside the file. Create an object to store the password for the database.

```
{
    "env": {
        "MONGO_ATLAS_PW": "password"
    }
}
```

5. replace "password" with string given in project submission form. (remember to use double quotes for valid JSON).

6. In the terminal run "npm start". this will begin nodemon and open a server on port 3000.

7. In the browser url type "localhost:3000" to view the application.
